This directory contains the bpf assembler included in the linux kernel
source tree in `tools/bpf`. Unfortunately that command line tool
is not generally available as a stand-alone tool, so we've extracted it
for our own use here, and integrated it with ekam.

The version contained here is as of commit
d76913908102044f14381df865bb74df17a538cb in the kernel repo.

This directory is released under the GPLv2 license, though note
that this is only used during the build process, and does not end up in
a shipped sandstorm bundle, so Sandstorm itself remains available
under the Apache 2.0 license.
